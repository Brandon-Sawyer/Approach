    /**** User Trait ****
     * 
     *  This trait is used to add user functionality to an Approach Resource.
     * 
     *  Anything you add here will be available to the primary resource of
     *  this namespace. 
     * 
     *  This is a good place to use hooks and/or override methods to achieve
     *  desired functionality.
     * 
     *  Examples include: 
     *    - Adding a user_id property
     *    - Changing the behavior of the load() or save() method
     *    - Adding behavior with preload(), onsave(), postpush(), onpull(), preacquire(), etc..
     *    - Adding functions that work with your custom operations and aspects
     *    - Tieing into the map system deeper
     * 
     * This trait is automatically included in the class that is generated, so
     * you can use it immediately. This file is here for your convenience
     * and will not be overwritten by the generator.
     *
