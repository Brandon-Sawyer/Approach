Current priority team activities. 

Every team is expected to constantly have 2 to 5 yellow (or higher) activities in their queue. 

Prioritize time-to-delivery over adding new features. Generally when working on Yellow Goals, it is better to work toward a minimum viable implementation while keeping good coding standards. Your team or layer support should already have an idea of the basic requirements.

If you see a simple all-around improvement while implementing, go ahead and try it out. 

However, for notable changes, please consider suggesting ideas as a new goal on the post-climb discussion page. Harvesting new ideas into the docs lets other teams take inspiration from improvements as they happen.
