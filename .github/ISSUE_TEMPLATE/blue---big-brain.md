Blue Goals are long term goals.

These may require a great deal of experimentation, long wait times or simply do advance very quickly. However these goals are not low priority. 

Blue Goals contain the concepts we want to see in the future and major features that could change parts of the system, but may be quite complex. Consider them the Approach equivalent of and RFC.

As such, teams or individuals who have taken on a Blue Goal are requested to submit a TPS report every 2-3 months to remind the community of the goal and its status.

This 'Total Project Synopsis' is fairly simple.

If the project was OUTLINED originally, copy just the outline or last report, and represent the changelog:
- Mark finished items, in-progress items, researched items and untouched items
- Summarize difficulties encountered between the last two-week report and now
- Summarize the main findings of any research and exploratory development 
- SHORT Summary of project purpose and status as a whole

Plus:
- Anything the team wishes to convey to community about the project, if desired
- Your opinion of the direction the project is going 
- Your assessment of productivity since the last TPS report
- Your assessment of the value/time trade-off of this project




- Your assessment of team lead (handling of actual task implementation)
- Your assessment of team management (handling of organization, teamwork..)



It is not required to go into great detail; or even use great English. However be CLEAR even if that means having to take time to write something out well. If you can be clear briefly, great. 

Also, if you make a nicely formed document -- please attach it to a card requesting we make it a template and add to our workflow documentation. Use templates to make reporting less stressful. 

It should only take 15 minutes to 2 hours of your job every 2 weeks to catch up on all the reports for cards completed in the last 2 weeks. If you experience trouble with this let us know as it suggests we should debug our workflow algorithm.
