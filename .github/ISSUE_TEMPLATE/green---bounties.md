Active Contributors are encouraged to always have 2 Green Goals.
No more, no less.

These goals may come from any of your teams, as long as you are one of the active workers the team assigned to the goal.

Green Goals are considered "bounties" as they are valuable tasks which can be completed
- out-of-sync with any mission critical timelines, so not linked to the next minor-version update
- in less than 14 days by a team at active pace, or up to 3 months for side-jobs
- general volunteer and contributors can work bounties with or without doing the climb process. 
   (only counts toward Active Contributor status if you do the climb)

Green Goals may be proposed by anyone but must have derived a precise scope and well specified deliverables.

Often the solution may be designed, or the task will be to design a solution. 

Generally these tasks are meant to range from 2-14 dayâ€™s work with a granularity of about two days. Where 1 day is roughly 1 large, 2 medium or 3 small code sessions.
